# hyprland-meowing-toggle
!!!NEEDS WTYPE TO WORK!!!
add this entry to your hyprland config file:

``` bind = SUPER SHIFT CONTROL, period, exec, .config/hypr/scripts/meow/toggle.sh ``` 


toggle bind (super shift + period) for meowing between meow texts nya

create a scripts file in your hypr folder (if you dont have one already) and send the meow folder there
doesnt seem to work with goofcord (for whatever reason the spaces arent sent) but works with the normal client and the web browser app ∆ê:meow üêà‚Äç‚¨õ

probably will break as i am a dumbass
